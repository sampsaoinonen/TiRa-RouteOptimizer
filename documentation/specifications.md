# Specification Document for RouteOptimizer

  

  

## 1. Programming Languages

**In this project:**
  

-  **Primary Language**: Python will be used to implement the core algorithms A* and Fringe Search, as well as handling the backend of the application.
  

-  **Frontend**: The user interface (UI) may be developed using **React** with **JavaScript** for rendering and interactivity of the street network and route visualizations.

  

  

**I can peer review projects written in the following languages:**

  

- Python

 

- Javascript

  

- Java

  
- SQL
  

## 2. Algorithms and Data Structures

  

-  **Algorithms will be chosen from these**:

  

-  **A***: Pathfinding algorithm that combines Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm with a heuristic to guide the search.

  

-  **Dijkstra**: Widely used algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph, without a heuristic.

  

-  **Jump Point Search (JPS)**: An optimization of A* designed to reduce the number of nodes expanded in grid-based pathfinding.

  

-  **Fringe Search**: A variation of A* optimized for memory usage, useful for large graphs.

  

  

## 3. Problem to Solve

  

- The primary problem is finding the shortest and most efficient path between two points (intersections) in a city street network. The project will compare the efficiency of multiple pathfinding algorithms, which include A* and Fringe Search, in terms of execution time and memory usage.

  

  

## 4. Input and Usage

  

-  **Input**: The program will take a street network as input, represented as a graph with nodes (intersections) and edges (streets). Users will select the starting and destination points, and optionally add obstacles such as closed roads or increased weights for traffic.

  

-  **Usage**:

  

- The selected algorithm (A* or Fringe Search) will find the shortest path between the start and destination points.

  

- The resulting path, along with performance metrics (e.g., execution time, memory usage), will be displayed to the user.

  

## 5. References

  

- Wikipedia articles on [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), and [Fringe Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_search) on understanding of these algorithms.

  
  

  

## 6. Core Focus of the Project

  

- The core of this project is the **pathfinding algorithms**, specifically comparing algorithms such as A* and Fringe Search in terms of performance and effectiveness in solving the shortest path problem on a city street network.

  

-  **Visualization** and **network rendering** are supporting components that help users interact with the system but are secondary to the algorithms' implementation and analysis.

  

  

## 7. Study Program

  

- I am enrolled in the **Bachelor’s in Computer Science (bSc)** program at the University of Helsinki.

  

- This specification and all documentation for the project will be written in **English**.
