# Weekly Report 2

### What did I do this week?
- Set up Poetry for dependency management
- Built a version of the A* algorithm with the Haversine heuristic
- Used OSMnx and Matplotlib dependencies for handling maps and visualizations
- Tested the A* algorithm with the Helsinki OSMnx graph and created route visualizations using Matplotlib
- Wrote unit tests for the A* algorithm
- Compared the performance of the A* algorithm with NetworkX's built-in Dijkstra in unit tests
- Implemented test coverage tracking with Coverage.py
- Focused on writing clear docstrings and comments

### How has the project progressed?
The project has progressed pretty good this week. The A* algorithm with Haversine heuristic has been successfully implemented and tested using the Helsinki OSMnx graph. Visualizations of the shortest path have been created with Matplotlib, and unit tests have been written to ensure the algorithm functions correctly. Comparisons between the A* algorithm and NetworkXâ€™s Dijkstra have been integrated into the tests. Test coverage tracking has also been established.

### What did I learn this week / today?
- There are different ways to calculate distances between points, such as Manhattan, Euclidean, and Haversine...
- I gained a deeper understanding of several pathfinding algorithms.

### What was unclear or caused difficulties?
- Fringe Search is still under study and needs more focus.

### What will I do next?
- Implement the Fringe Search algorithm
- Research the technology to be used for the user interface
